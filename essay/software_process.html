Software development process 

Why is software development so difficult? Why is delivering on time, ensuring quality and process improvement
more difficult than in other disciplines? In order to improve the process, it is imperative to know what the challenges
are. 

There are several factors that contribute to development and delivery complexity.
	The perception that changes are easy and immediate 
		Corallary: Requirement changes frequently don't address the effort required. 
	Artistic vs. rote approach to implementation
	Vastly different productivity levels of individuals
	Employee turnover rate and amount of time to come up to speed on a code base. 
	Rapidly changing technologies and industry standards
	Standardization of process and metrics across an organization

Everybody wants to be productive and recognized for their contributions to an organization. Any software process needs to work 
for all developers contributing to a code base. With varying levels of ability in a developement team, too much process can
make exceptional workers feel encumbered and unproductive while too little process can make less talented workers feel "in the way".
A failure to consider how individuals contribute is a major factor in poorly organized development teams. 

Engineers tend to be smart. And with that comes a certain amount of ego. Sometimes an exceptional amount of ego. In order to cater
to this, software organizations may allow engineers to use their preferred tools and development environments. While this provides
an easier transition into an organization, it makes it more difficult to transfer projects between team members.
